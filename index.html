      <h1>Hello! I'm Turkan, a Frontend developer based in Russia.</h1>

          <p class="about_me-text">
            As a university student specializing in applied informatics, I am
            committed to improving my programming skills and expanding my
            knowledge in the IT industry. I dedicate a significant amount of
            time to CodeCademy courses, where I focus on learning new concepts
            and techniques. In addition, I regularly research documentation to
            deepen my understanding of different programming languages and
            tools. My interest in technology drives me to continually improve,
            as I see the potential it holds for creating innovative solutions.
          </p>
          <p class="about_me-text">
            Beyond my academic pursuits, I find joy in activities that nurture
            my creativity and curiosity. Whether I'm capturing moments through
            photography, taking peaceful walks, or getting lost in the pages of
            a good book, I'm always seeking inspiration. I love to learn new
            languages and currently I know English, Russian, Turkish, and
            Azerbaijani in various levels. This linguistic journey has not only
            broadened my perspective but also deepened my appreciation for
            different cultures. As I search for my place in the IT industry, I'm
            driven by a desire to contribute meaningfully and grow both
            personally and professionally. Every day, I push myself to learn
            more, improve my skills, and embrace the challenges that come my
            way. I'm excited about the journey ahead and eager to see where my
            passion for technology will take me.
